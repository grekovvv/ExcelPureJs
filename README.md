# Resume

During the course, I came to the conclusion that it is certainly useful to know how to write your own framework from zero and tinker with the design. 
But I personally would not pay so much attention to this, but would use ready-made themes and components. 
It is clear that this course is for front-end developers who will actually make these themes and components. 
Apparently, I don't consider myself one of them. I like to make this machine work better. Full stack game, where you take a ready-made front and play with it like with origami.
