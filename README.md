Completed this course [Продвинутый JavaScript. Создание Excel на чистом js](https://result.school/products/advanced-js)

Minin is good teacher. Thank you for this course and your youtube.

# Resume

During the course, I came to the conclusion that it is certainly useful to know how to write your own framework from zero and tinker with the design. 
But I personally would not pay so much attention to this, but would use ready-made themes and components. 
It is clear that this course is for front-end developers who will actually make these themes and components. 
Apparently, I don't consider myself one of them. I like to make this machine work better. Full stack game, where you take a ready-made front and play with it like with origami.

When I passed course, I understood that it is not need you. Realy. If you wanna learn js use any other course, but not this. This course just help understand how organized frameworks inside. You writing your framework. Sounds good, but in real life all what you do in this course, you will not do. Idk whom it need. For me be helpfullness only first half part course. Everything else be too much.

I'm not recomended this course. Use tutorial for any technologies or language, this be better for you.

But Vladilen, thank you.
